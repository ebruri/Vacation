      <h1>Welcome to Datca</h1>
      <p>A sliver of mountain and beach jutting in to the Aegean offers an oasis of unspoilt tranquillity amid the lively resorts of south-west Turkey
      </p>
      <p>The spindly, 50-mile-long Datça peninsula in Turkey’s Muğla province is a dagger of pure green at the meeting point of the Aegean and the Mediterranean, and is as unsullied as south-west Turkey gets. The ancient Greeks believed Datça to have been created personally by Zeus, so gorgeous are its rocky outcrops and aquamarine waters. The geographer Strabo apparently said: “God sent his beloved creatures to Datça for them to live longer.”</p>

            <p class="card-text=">
              The peninsula has coves, bays, and beaches in abundance. Sandy or shingly, they all share the same, alluring, crystalline turquoise waters. Often the water remains shallow for some distance offshore, making it safe for young children. In the quiet village of Orhaniye, there’s an elongated sandbank you can walk on, out into the bay. East of Knidos, the charming fishing village of Palamut Bükü is known for its fish restaurants and its 2km-long beach.

            <h2 class="card-title">Old town Datca</h2>
            <p class="card-text=">Once the peninsula’s main village, Eski Datça (Old Datça), lapsed into obscurity in the late 20th century. Now it has been partially restored by second homers from Istanbul, Ankara and further afield. It’s a beautiful patchwork of stone-paved lanes, kitchen gardens, pot plants, bougainvillea-drenched walls, and little cafes and shops. Drop into the old stone house of the late poet Can Yücel.
